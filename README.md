# PufferFish
This project features a visually engaging login page themed around the aquatic environment of pufferfish. The page incorporates HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and CSS animations to bring the pufferfish to life, creating an interactive and appealing user experience. Note that this is a frontend-only implementation as of now.
Key Features:
Aquatic Themed Design: The page is styled with a blue gradient background, reminiscent of underwater scenery.
Animated Pufferfish: CSS animations make the pufferfish swim in a wave-like pattern, adding a dynamic visual element.
Login Form: A user-friendly login form is included on the right side of the page, with inputs for email and password, "Remember Me" functionality, and links for forgotten passwords and account creation.
Interactive Elements: Buttons for Google, complete with hover effects, enhance the interactive experience.
