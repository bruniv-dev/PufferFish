# PufferFish
This project features a visually engaging login page themed around the aquatic environment of pufferfish. The page incorporates HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and CSS animations to bring the pufferfish to life, creating an interactive and appealing user experience. Note that this is a frontend-only implementation as of now.
