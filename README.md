# PufferFish
Puffer Fish Login Page

This project features a visually engaging login page themed around the aquatic environment of pufferfish. 

The page incorporates HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and CSS animations to bring the pufferfish to life, creating an interactive and appealing user experience. Note that this is a frontend-only implementation as of now.

Key Features:

Aquatic Themed Design: The page is styled with a blue gradient background, reminiscent of underwater scenery.

Animated Pufferfish: CSS animations make a single pufferfish move in up and down pattern, adding a dynamic visual element.

Bubbles Animation: Bubbles rise to the surface at varying speeds and sizes, adding to the underwater atmosphere.

Shadow Animation: A shadow beneath the pufferfish adjusts dynamically as the fish moves, enhancing the 3D effect.

Login Form: A user-friendly login form is included on the right side of the page, with inputs for email and password, "Remember Me" functionality, and links for forgotten passwords and account creation.

Interactive Elements: Buttons for Google, complete with hover effects, enhance the interactive experience.

Aquatic Plants: Imaginary aquatic plants are subtly incorporated into the design, enhancing the underwater ambiance.
